AI-Assisted In Silico Design of Engineered E. coli for Sustainable Biofuel Precursor Production
Project Overview
This project explores the computational design of engineered Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) for sustainable production of biofuel precursors from waste feedstocks. The system produces two key biofuel precursors:

Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEEs) from whey permeate lactose
Alkanes from waste palm oil triglycerides

The project demonstrates a complete R&D pipeline from metabolic pathway design through technoeconomic analysis, utilizing AI-assisted computational biology tools.

Scientific Approach
Metabolic Pathways
FAEE Production (from Lactose):

Lactose → Glucose + Galactose (β-galactosidase)
Glucose → Acetyl-CoA (glycolysis)
Acetyl-CoA → Fatty acids (fatty acid synthase)
Fatty acids + Ethanol → FAEEs (alcohol acetyltransferase)

Alkane Production (from Triglycerides):

Triglycerides → Fatty acids (lipase)
Fatty acids → Fatty aldehydes (acyl-ACP reductase)
Fatty aldehydes → Alkanes (aldehyde deformylating oxygenase)

Gene Circuit Design

FAEE Circuit: LacI/P_lac regulatory system with lactose-responsive induction
Alkane Circuit: FadR/P_fadBA regulatory system with fatty acid-responsive induction
Plasmid Architecture: Independent pGGa-dest vectors with ampicillin resistance
